include::docs/best-practices
This repository contains curated instructional and illustrative content used to train a multi-agent LLM system capable of generating cohesive, cloud-native, microservice-based DevOps project templates.

== Purpose

The goal of this knowledge base is to teach domain-specific LLM agents to:

- Generate production-ready Helm charts, Dockerfiles, GitHub Actions, and IaC templates
- Collaborate across domains while sharing consistent architectural conventions
- Align output with best-in-class practices from proven sources like Cloud Posse

== Domains

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a major DevOps discipline:

* ci-cd/ :: Workflow orchestration, job reusability, and GitHub integration
* containerization/ :: Docker image building, optimization, and publishing
* kubernetes-helm/ :: Kubernetes deployment via Helm charts and manifest patterns
* gitops/ :: Continuous delivery with ArgoCD and Git repository structure
* infra-code/ :: Terraform module composition and multi-layer IaC
* cloud-integrations/ :: AWS IAM, networking, and platform-specific patterns
* observability/ :: Logging, metrics, dashboards, and alert definitions
* security/ :: Permissions, secrets, CI/CD scan policies
* scaffolding/ :: End-to-end project blueprints and layout conventions

== Shared Context

The shared/ folder includes architecture overviews, a DevOps glossary, and general conventions that all agents reference for consistency.

== Updating Content

This dataset is periodically refreshed from authoritative sources like `https://docs.cloudposse.com` using automated scraping and Git-based syncing tools.
